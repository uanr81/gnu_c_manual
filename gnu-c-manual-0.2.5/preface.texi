@cindex preface

This is a reference manual for the C programming language as implemented
by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Specifically, this manual aims to
document:

@itemize

@item The 1989 ANSI C standard, commonly known as ``C89''
@item The 1999 ISO C standard, commonly known as ``C99'', to the extent that C99 is implemented by GCC
@item The current state of GNU extensions to standard C

@end itemize

@noindent
This manual describes C89 as its baseline. C99 features and GNU extensions are
explicitly labeled as such.

By default, GCC will compile code as C89 plus GNU-specific extensions.  Much
of C99 is supported; once full support is available, the default compilation
dialect will be C99 plus GNU-specific extensions.  (Some of the
GNU extensions to C89 ended up, sometimes slightly modified, as standard
language features in C99.)

The C language includes a set of preprocessor directives, which are used for
things such as macro text replacement, conditional compilation, and file
inclusion.  Although normally described in a C language manual, the GNU C 
preprocessor has been thoroughly documented in @cite{The C Preprocessor},
a separate manual which covers preprocessing for C, C++, and Objective-C
programs, so it is not included here.
