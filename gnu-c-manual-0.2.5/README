The GNU C Reference Manual
==========================

(This manual is part of the GNU Project.)

This is a reference manual covering the C programming language as
implemented by the GNU C compiler.  It does not cover the C libraries.
THIS MANUAL IS STILL INCOMPLETE!  As of 26 August 2016, this is a
work-in-progress, and should not be misconstrued as a finished project.

The Texinfo source for this manual is split into several files, with
one file per chapter.  You can use the Makefile to build the manual,
or run `makeinfo', `texi2dvi', etc., directly on `gnu-c-manual.texi'.
